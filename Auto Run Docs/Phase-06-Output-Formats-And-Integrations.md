# Phase 06: Output Formats and Integrations

> **Branch Directive:** All work for this phase MUST be done on the `claude-overhaul` branch. Push commits to `origin/claude-overhaul` only. Do NOT push to `master` or `main`.

This phase adds multiple output formats to make Hamburglar's findings consumable by other tools and workflows. SARIF output enables integration with GitHub Advanced Security and other code scanning tools. CSV enables spreadsheet analysis. The optional database backend allows centralizing findings across multiple scans for trend analysis and reporting.

## Tasks

- [x] Create `src/hamburglar/outputs/sarif.py` with a `SarifOutput` class that: generates SARIF 2.1.0 compliant JSON, maps findings to SARIF result objects, includes rule definitions for each detector, adds file location information with line numbers, includes severity mapping (error/warning/note), adds Hamburglar as the tool driver, validates output against SARIF schema
  - **Completed:** Added `SarifOutput` class with full SARIF 2.1.0 compliance, severity-to-level mapping (CRITICAL/HIGH→error, MEDIUM→warning, LOW/INFO→note), security-severity scores, fingerprints for deduplication, and support for line numbers, columns, and end lines.

  - **Completed:** Added `CsvOutput` class with full RFC 4180 compliance including CRLF line endings, proper quoting of fields with special characters (commas, newlines, quotes), configurable delimiter (comma by default), optional headers, and full Unicode support including emojis.

- [x] Create `src/hamburglar/outputs/html_output.py` with an `HtmlOutput` class that: generates standalone HTML report, includes summary statistics, groups findings by file and severity, includes collapsible sections for each file, syntax highlights matched content, adds severity color coding, is viewable without external dependencies
  - **Completed:** Added `HtmlOutput` class that generates self-contained HTML reports with inline CSS (no external dependencies). Features include: summary statistics with stat cards (total findings, matches, files affected, files scanned), severity breakdown badges, findings grouped by file with collapsible `<details>` sections, files and findings sorted by severity (critical first), severity color coding with configurable colors, syntax highlighting for matched content in `<code>` blocks, context display in `<pre>` blocks, line number display, XSS prevention via proper HTML escaping, full Unicode support including emojis, responsive design with mobile-friendly CSS, and Hamburglar attribution in footer.

  - **Completed:** Added `MarkdownOutput` class that generates GitHub-flavored Markdown reports with: summary table (total findings, matches, files affected, files scanned, duration), severity breakdown table with emoji indicators, collapsible `<details>` sections for grouping findings by file, relative file path links with configurable `base_path`, severity ordering (critical first), line number display, code fences for context, backtick inline code for matches, Markdown character escaping to prevent formatting issues, custom title support, and Hamburglar attribution in footer. Added 72 comprehensive tests achieving 100% code coverage.

- [x] Create `src/hamburglar/storage/__init__.py` with `BaseStorage` abstract class defining: `save_scan(result: ScanResult)`, `get_scans(filter)`, `get_findings(filter)`, `get_statistics()`
  - **Completed:** Added `BaseStorage` abstract class with four abstract methods (`save_scan`, `get_scans`, `get_findings`, `get_statistics`) plus context manager support and `close()` method. Also added: `ScanFilter` and `FindingFilter` dataclasses for query filtering with support for date range, path, severity, detector, pagination (limit/offset); `StoredScan` dataclass wrapping ScanResult with storage metadata (scan_id, stored_at); `ScanStatistics` dataclass for aggregate statistics (totals, breakdowns by severity/detector/date, averages); `StorageError` exception with backend and operation context; `StorageRegistry` for managing storage backend instances; `default_registry` global instance. Added 66 comprehensive tests achieving 95% code coverage.

  - **Completed:** Added `SqliteStorage` class implementing the `BaseStorage` interface with full SQLite persistence. Features include: schema with scans, findings, and detectors tables plus indexes for efficient querying; UUID-based scan IDs; JSON serialization of matches, metadata, and stats; filtering by date range (since/until), target path, file path, detector name, severity levels, min/max findings; pagination with limit/offset; aggregate statistics (totals, breakdowns by severity/detector/date, averages); thread-safe concurrent access using thread-local connections and WAL journal mode; context manager support; `get_scan_by_id`, `delete_scan`, and `clear` helper methods; schema versioning for future migrations.

- [x] Create `src/hamburglar/storage/json_file.py` with a `JsonFileStorage` class that: appends scan results to a JSON lines file, supports reading historical scans, provides simple file-based persistence, useful for CI/CD pipelines
  - **Completed:** Added `JsonFileStorage` class implementing the `BaseStorage` interface with JSON Lines (newline-delimited JSON) file persistence. Features include: appending scan results to a single .jsonl file for streaming and easy parsing; thread-safe writes using file locking (fcntl); reading historical scans with filtering by date range (since/until), target path, file path, detector name, severity levels, min/max findings; pagination with limit/offset; aggregate statistics (totals, breakdowns by severity/detector/date, averages); `get_scan_by_id` and `clear` helper methods; context manager support; full Unicode support including emojis; suitable for CI/CD pipelines where results are appended across multiple runs. Added 92 comprehensive tests covering initialization, save/read operations, filtering, statistics, concurrent access, error handling, edge cases, and CI/CD use cases. 100% test pass rate achieved.

- [x] Update CLI `--format` option to support: json, table, sarif, csv, html, markdown
  - **Completed:** Extended the `OutputFormat` enum to include SARIF, CSV, HTML, and MARKDOWN formats. Added `VALID_FORMATS` mapping for CLI validation, `FORMAT_FORMATTERS` mapping from format to formatter class, and `get_formatter()` helper function. Updated all three CLI commands (scan, scan-git, scan-web) to validate and use all six formats. Updated help text to list all available formats. Structured formats (JSON, SARIF, CSV) are printed directly to preserve formatting, while visual formats (table, HTML, markdown) use Rich console. Added 36 comprehensive tests in `tests/test_cli_formats.py` covering all format options, case-insensitivity, file output, quiet mode, empty directories, and verbose mode. Updated existing tests in `test_cli_errors.py` to reflect newly valid formats.

  - **Completed:** Added `--output-dir` option to all three CLI commands (scan, scan-git, scan-web). Features include: auto-generated filenames based on target name and timestamp in format `hamburglar_{scan_type}_{target}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}{extension}`; `FORMAT_EXTENSIONS` mapping for correct file extensions (.json, .sarif.json, .csv, .html, .md, .txt); `generate_output_filename()` helper with smart target name extraction (URL domain for web, repo name for git, directory name for local scans); character sanitization for filesystem safety; nested directory creation; validation that `--output` and `--output-dir` cannot be used together; verbose mode shows generated output file path. Added 34 comprehensive tests in `tests/test_cli_output_dir.py` covering filename generation, directory creation, all format extensions, conflict detection, quiet/verbose modes, and help text.
