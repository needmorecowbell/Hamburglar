Description: Introduction to yara-ctypes-python
        **********************************
        
        What's in yara-ctypes:
        
        * A ctypes libyara wrapper module which exposes libyara's exports into the
          Python runtime (see: `yara-project's libyara v1.7`_).
        * A thread safe Rules object with an interface that is compatible with the
          interface exposed in the yara-project CPython extension module.
        * namespace management to allow easy loading of multiple YARA rules into a
          single Rules matching object. 
        * Various Scanner class types to enable thread or process pool execution
          of matching requests over a Rules object.
        * A feature rich command line interface that gives the user many options to
          control how they may wish to perform a scan.  
        
        
        Why:
        
        * ctypes releases the GIL on system function calls...  Run your PC to its
          true potential.
        * It simplifies things a lot by keeping high order logic such as managing rules
          paths, filtering paths, controlling pooled execution, etc. inside of a
          language such as Python.
        * No more building the PyC extension...  
        * I found a few bugs and memory leaks and wanted to make my life simple.

        Install and run
        ===============
        
        Simply run the following::
        
            > python setup.py install
            > python setup.py test
            > yara-ctypes -h
        
        or `PyPi`_:: 
        
            > pip install yara
            > yara-ctypes -h
        
        
        .. note::
        
            If the package does not contain a pre-compiled libyara library for your
            platform you will need to build and install it. See `notes on building`_.
        
        
        Compatability
        =============
